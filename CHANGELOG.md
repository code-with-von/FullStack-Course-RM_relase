IF you find any, please feel free to open contact me directly via [email](mailto:vonschappler_dev@outlook.com?subject=I've%20found%20grammar%20or%20typos%20in%20the%20application%20Webdev%20Course&body=Please%20describe%20the%20grammar%20or%20typo%20error%20you%20found%20in%20the%20with%20details%20below:).

### Windows users:
As for now, the application does not have any digital signature and this imples that .

If you dont like to see those operational system warnings and still wish to use this application, please consider being an sponsor of this project, so I can work on the requirements to digitally sign this application.

### Mac and Linux users:
If you are either a MacOs or Linux user, please note that the application is currently only available for Windows.
